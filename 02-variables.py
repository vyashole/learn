# you can use any variable name (identifier) that starts with a letter [a-zA-z] or and underscore [_]
# when you assign a value(literal) to an identifier, it becomes a variable in python
# int literals are represented by just writing an integer
x = 5
# float literals can be represented by their decimal value
y = 10.5
# a string is a sequence of characters. string literal can be represented using 'quotes' or "double quotes"
name = "Aishwarya 123 %$.."

# list can be represented using [] square brackets and commas
some_list = [1, 2, "foo", 3, "bar"]

# all these variables can be accessed using their name, Here we passed their names to the print statement as parameters
print(x, y, name, some_list)
