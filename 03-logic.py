# just declaring some variables for use here
x = 5
y = 10.5
z = 5

# Booleans: Booleans are logical values that can be True or False
# you can use logical operators to check if an expression is True or False
print(y > x)  # True
print(x == y)  # False
print(z < x)  # True

# Here are the different operators
# This will be useful in if statements and loops
# Cpmparison Operators
# == 	Equal (note the double equal signs single equals is used for assignment)
# != 	Not equal
# > 	Greater than
# < 	Less than
# >= 	Greater than or equal
# <= 	Less than or equal
# Logical Operators
# and  	Returns True if both expressions are true
# or 	Returns True if one of the expressions is true
# not 	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
# Examples:
print(x > 3 and x < 10)
print(x > 3 or x < 4)
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))
